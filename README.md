# Apple-Store-Sales-SQL-Analysis
## Introduction
This project analyzes Apple retail sales and warranty claims using PostgreSQL. The goal is to uncover insights about store performance, country contributions, product claims, and sales growth over time. By combining SQL queries with business-focused questions, I transformed raw data into actionable insights.

## Background
Apple operates retail stores worldwide, and analyzing sales and warranty claims provides valuable information on product performance, customer behavior, and market contributions. This project simulates such an environment with a dataset of sales, stores, products, and warranty claims.

### The analysis answers key questions like:

1. Which stores and countries contribute most to overall sales?
2. What are the top-selling products and categories?
3. How do warranty claims compare across price ranges?
4. What are the sales growth patterns over time?
## Tools I Used
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Üí For database management and writing SQL queries 
- **Excel** ‚Üí For creating charts and quick visual summaries  
- **GitHub** ‚Üí To share, document, and version-control the project  
- **ChatGPT** ‚Üí For drafting insights and speeding up analysis 
## The Analysis
## What I Learned
- üõ†Ô∏è **SQL Skills**  
  - Writing complex queries using **JOINs**, **subqueries**, and **window functions**  
  - Performing **aggregations** and **comparisons** across time and categories  
  - Using **running totals** and **growth ratios** directly in SQL  
- üìä **Analysis to Insights**  
  - Translating raw SQL query outputs into **clear business insights**  
  - Identifying **patterns, trends, and performance contributors**  
- üíª **Project & Portfolio Skills**  
  - Structuring and documenting a project for **GitHub portfolio presentation**  
  - Communicating results with **charts and summaries**  

## Conclusion
### Insights
Through SQL-based analysis, I identified patterns in Apple‚Äôs sales and warranty data:

- **United States** dominates sales contribution with **20% share**, far ahead of other countries.  
- **Asia-Pacific markets** (China, Japan, Singapore, Thailand) show **strong growth potential**, highlighting regional expansion opportunities.  
- **Certain product lines** (e.g., iPhones, MacBooks) consistently drive **both high sales and high warranty claims**.   
- Countries with **fewer stores** (e.g., Spain, Taiwan, Austria) still achieve notable sales contributions, indicating strong brand demand.  
- **Cumulative sales trends** reveal steady global growth, with minimal fluctuations year-over-year.    
- **Top stores** (like Apple Fukuoka, Union Square, Covent Garden) perform exceptionally, contributing disproportionately to sales.  
- Data suggests a **shift toward emerging markets** that could reshape future sales distribution.  
## Closing Thoughts
This project was a great exercise in combining SQL technical skills with business storytelling. It highlights how data analysts can turn structured queries into meaningful recommendations for business strategy.
